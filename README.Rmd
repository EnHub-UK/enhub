This platform integrates the strengths of pre-existing **housing stock energy models**, notably their delineation of stock composition and attribution, albeit in a simplified form. It incorporates functionalities to quantify uncertainties and assess the potential consequences of policies and strategies aimed at <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#ff5ea1-size:16px;line-height:1 ">decarbonising</span> the UK housing stock.


## Features

+ Development of an open-access modular platform

+ Generation of explicit volumetric archetypes based on survey data

+ Energy peformance evaluation using dynamic simulation (i.e. of envelope properties and household variables)

+ Standardisation of data and modelling algorithms

+ Housing stock evaluation

+ Analysis of drivers of decision-making regarding energy use intensity

+ Analysis of strategies at scale

+ Sensitivity analysis and multi-layered parametrisation

+ Decoupled processes, enabling the ability to make use of `High Performance Computing` facilities.




## System requirements

<p align="left">
  <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/R-4.4.2-blue.svg"></a>

</p>

## Installation

You can install the development version of EnHub from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
devtools::install_github("EnHub-UK/enhub", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

It may require a *token*. Define that *token* in `.Renviron`, which contains environment variables to be set in R sessions. Once defined---under an arbitrary name (eg. `GITHUBTOKEN`), the *token* needs to appear when calling `Sys.getenv()`.

```r
# To display all the environment variables
Sys.getenv()

# To display only the token value
Sys.getenv(c("GITHUBTOKEN"))
```

Use the argument `auth_token` in the installation command:

```r
devtools::install_github(
  "EnHub-UK/enhub", 
  build_vignettes = TRUE, 
  auth_token = Sys.getenv("GITHUBTOKEN"))
```



## Caveats

Due to the licenses of the the main data sources: **EHS** and **UK-TUS**, the related datasets are currently excluded from the R-project. These include: `s_ehs_2011_ext`, `s_ehs_2011_hhd`, `s_ehs_2011_rom`, `s_ehs_ml`, `s_tus` and `s_tus_ehs`, which are required as lists for the package to work.

The datasets may available upon request to the authors of the package.

The instructions to generate these files, using the companion repositories, are available in the vignettes.



## Setup

Load the library

```r
library(enhub)
```



## Usage

See the **vignettes** in the *documentation*
