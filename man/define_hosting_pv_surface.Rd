\description{
This function identifies suitable roof zones for hosting PV panels based on provided dimensions and map data.
It extracts relevant roof information, calculates slopes and dimensions, and determines candidate surfaces for PV installation.
Finally, it calculates the location of potential PV surfaces.

This function takes a list of origins as input and extracts the origin points
for each roof zone. The extracted points are then converted into a data frame
with additional information about the corresponding room.

This function extracts the vertex coordinates for a specific roof from a list of roofs.
The extracted vertices are converted into a data frame with columns for x, y, and z coordinates.

This function determines the slope, dimensions, and area of a roof
based on its vertex coordinates.

This function determines the coordinates of a PV surface based on its dimensions,
orientation, and position.
